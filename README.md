# Chihiros LED Control

This repository contains a python **CLI** script as well as a **Home Assistant integration** that can be used to control Chihiros LEDs for aquariums via bluetooth without the vendor app. For this purpose, the protocol to control the LED has been reversed engineered with the help of decompiling the old *Magic App* as well as sniffing and analyzing of bluetooth packages that are sent by the new *My Chihiros App*. The new app is based on flutter and only contains a binary that can not easily be analyzed.

## Supported Devices

* [Chihiros LED A2](https://www.chihirosaquaticstudio.com/products/chihiros-a-ii-built-in-bluetooth)
* [Chihiros WRGB II](https://www.chihirosaquaticstudio.com/products/chihiros-wrgb-ii-led-built-in-bluetooth) (Regular, Pro, Slim)
* Chihiros Tiny Terrarium Egg
* Chihiros C II (RGB, White)
* Chihiros Universal WRGB
* Chihiros Z Light TINY
* other LED models might work as well but are not tested

## Using the Home Assistant integration

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=themicdiet&repository=chihiros-led-control&category=Integration)

### Setup with HACS

* Inside HACS add this repository as a custom repository: `HACS -> Integrations -> 3 dots on the top right-> Custom repositories`
* Search for `Chihiros` in the repositories and download it
* Restart Home Assistant
* Go to the integrations user interface and add the Chihiros integration
* Supported devices should be discovered at this point

### Manual Setup

* Copy the directory `custom_components/chihiros` to your `<config dir>/custom_components` directory
* Restart Home-Assistant
* Add the Chihiros integration to your Home Assistant instance via the integrations user interface

## Requirements

* a device with bluetooth LE support for sending the commands to the LED
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) with pip

## Using the CLI

```bash
# setup the environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .

# show help
chihirosctl --help

# discover devices and their address
chihirosctl list-devices

## Protocol

The vendor app uses Bluetooth LE to communicate with the LED. The LED advertises a UART service with the UUID `6E400001-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`. This service contains a RX characteristic with the UUID `6E400002-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`. This characteristic can be used to send commands to the LED. The LED will respond to commands by sending a notification to the corresponding TX service with the UUID `6E400003-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`.

The commands are sent as a byte array with the following structure:

| Command ID | 1 | Command Length | Message ID High | Message ID Low | Mode | Parameters | Checksum |
| ---------- | - | -------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ---- | ---------- | -------- |

The checksum is calculated by XORing all bytes of the command together. The checksum is then added to the command as the last byte.

The message id is a 16 bit number that is incremented with each command. It is split into two bytes. The first byte is the high byte and the second byte is the low byte.

The command length is the number of parameters + 5.

### Manual Mode

The LED can be set to a specific brightness by sending the following command with the following options:

* Command ID: **90**
* Mode: **7**
* Parameters: [ **Color** (0-2), **Brightness** (0 - 100)]

On non-RGB models, the color parameter should be set to 0 to indicate white. On RGB models, each color's brightness is sent as a separate command. Red is 0, green is 1, blue is 2.

### Auto Mode

To switch to auto mode, the following command can be used:

* Command ID: **90**
* Mode: **5**
* Parameters: [ **18**, **255**, **255** ]

With auto mode enabled, the LED can be set to automatically turn on and off at a specific time. The following command can be used to create a new setting:

* Command ID: **165**
* Mode: **25**
* Parameters: [ **sunrise hour**, **sunrise minutes**, **sunset hour**, **sunset minutes**, **ramp up minutes**, **weekdays**, **red brightness**, **green brightness**, **blue brightness**, 5x **255** ]

The weekdays are encoded as a sequence of 7 bits with the following structure: `Monday Thuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday`. A bit is set to 1 if the LED should be on on that day. It is only possible to set one setting per day i.e. no conflicting settings. There is also a maximum of 7 settings.

On non-RGB models, the desired brightness should be set as the red brightness while the other two colors should be set to **255**.

To deactivate a setting, the same command can be used but the brightness has to be set to **255**.

#### Set Time

The current time is required for auto mode and can be set by sending the following command:

* Command ID: **90**

* Mode: **9**

* Parameters: [ **year - 2000**, **month**, **weekday**, **hour**, **minute**, **second** ]

* Weekday is 1 - 7 for Monday - Sunday

#### Reset Auto Mode Settings

The auto mode and its settings can be reset by sending the following command:

* Command ID: **90**
* Mode: **5**
* Parameters: [ **5**, **255**, **255** ]

## Doser Additions (Beta)

> The doser protocol and entities are **beta**. Home Assistant now exposes manual dosing, daily total sensors, and scheduling services, but firmware differences may still affect reliability. Please report any quirks you encounter.

### Supported Doser Devices

* Chihiros DY/D series dosing pumps (1–4 channels). Names often include `D1…D4`, `DOSE`, or `DYDOSE`.

### Home Assistant (Doser)

* **Services:**

  * `chihiros.dose_ml` — one-shot manual dose on a selected channel (mL)

    ```yaml
    service: chihiros.dose_ml
    data:
      device_id: <select your doser>
      channel: 1       # human-friendly 1..4 (converted to wire 0..3)
      ml: 10.5         # 0.2 .. 999.9 (0.1 mL resolution)
    ```
  * `chihiros.read_daily_totals` — query today’s per-channel totals and surface them in HA
  * `chihiros.set_24h_dose` — configure a once-per-day schedule (time, days, catch-up)

* **Entities:**

  * Buttons/Numbers per channel for dosing operations
  * Daily total sensors (per channel) reporting today’s totals in mL

### Using the CLI (Doser)

Additional CLI commands are available alongside the LED commands:

```bash
# Manual one-shot dose (wire channel index 0..3)
chihirosctl set-dosing-pump-manuell-ml <device-address> --ch-id 0 --ch-ml 10.5

# Add a 24-hour daily dose at HH:MM; amount in tenths of mL (e.g., 800 = 80.0 mL)
chihirosctl add-setting-dosing-pump <device-address> 08:15 --ch-id 0 --weekdays everyday --ch-ml 800

# Enable auto mode for a dosing channel
chihirosctl enable-auto-mode-dosing-pump <device-address> --ch-id 0

# Send a raw A5 frame (advanced)
chihirosctl raw-dosing-pump <device-address> --cmd-id 165 --mode 27 0 0 14 02 0 0

# Decode/inspect frames (useful for captures)
chihirosctl bytes-encode "5B 01 0A 00 01 22 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"
```

> Note: HA services use **1–4** for channels; the CLI uses the wire index **0–3**.

### Doser Protocol Notes

* **UART** (same as LEDs)

  * Service: `6E400001-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`
  * RX (write): `6E400002-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`
  * TX (notify): `6E400003-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`

* **Immediate manual dose**

  * Command ID **0xA5 (165)**, Mode **0x1B (27)**
  * Params: `[ channel(0..3), 0, 0, ml_hi, ml_lo ]`
    `ml_hi = floor(ml/25.6)`, `ml_lo = round((ml - ml_hi*25.6)*10)` (0.1 mL)

* **24-hour daily schedule**
  Typical sequence observed on devices:

  * Time/type: `A5/0x15` → `[ ch, 1 /*24h*/, hour, minute, 0, 0 ]`
  * Amount:    `A5/0x1B` → `[ ch, weekday_mask, 1, 0, ml_hi, ml_lo ]`
  * Catch-up:  `A5/0x20` → `[ ch, 0, catch_up(0/1) ]`

* **“Daily totals” query**

  * Query frames: LED-style `0x5B/0x22` or `0x5B/0x1E` (no params)
  * Replies include 8 params (hi/lo pairs) decoding to four per-channel mL totals.

* **Checksums / message IDs**

  * Same XOR checksum and incrementing message-ID mechanism as LEDs.
  * Firmware quirks (e.g., avoiding `0x5A` in checksum or payload bytes) are handled by the encoder.
